This repository contains MATLAB-based practical exercises (TP) for data analysis, signal processing, and visualization. Developed as part of a course curriculum, the code demonstrates fundamental and advanced MATLAB functionalities, including data manipulation, mathematical modeling, and graphical representation. Each script is structured with clear function definitions, inline comments, and modular design to ensure readability and reusability.

Key Features

Data analysis and signal processing workflows
Modular scripts with well-documented code
Graphical visualization of results
Requirements

MATLAB (R2020b or later)
